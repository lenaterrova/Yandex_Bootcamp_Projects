# Mobile Game App Monetization

### Task

To recommend monetization models for mobile game app. 

### Problem

Mobile game app is going to start showing ads to users. We need to find best time and frequency for showing ads (or consider any other options). If we start showing ads too early the user will churn, and if it's too late we won't reach payback for a long time.

### Steps

1. Data cleaning and EDA 

2. Mapping main player game strategies

3. Testing statistical hypothesis

4. Diving into marketing metrics

5. Calculating unit economics, recommending monetization models 


### Datasets description

We have three datasets. Main dataset contains data on activities committed by users in the mobile game. We have information only about users who played the first level of the game which can be completed in a different ways depending on player's strategy. Our target activity here is completion of the level (some of the users finished it and some did not). We have data for first users of the application â€” a cohort of users who started playong game in the period of time from May 4 to May 10. Two other datasets have information on marketing activities (traffic sources and costs).

### Tools

Python, Pandas, data viz libraries (seaborn, matplotlib), scipy, Tableau
