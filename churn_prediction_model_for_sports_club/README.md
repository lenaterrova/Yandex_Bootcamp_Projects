### Task

To predict clients' churn, conduct customer segmentation via cluster analysis and recommend marketing activities for churn prevention. 

### Problem

We need to analyze our clients and find out if there are those groups (clusters) who are more likely to churn than the others. Also we don't know what are the signs of churn happening more likely in the near future. Knowing the least loyal groups of clients we can adjust our marketing activities to prevent clients from churning. 


### Steps

1. Data processing and EDA 

2. Churn prediction model

3. Customer segmentation / Cluster Analysis

4. Results & Recommendations


### Datasets description

We have one datasets with 4000 rows and 14 columns. It contains clients' data and the label of churn for each client. 

### Tools

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Cluster Analysis
